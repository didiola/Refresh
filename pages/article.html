                <p>I have been thinking over the past few weeks, how people are able to endure painful situations,
                    navigating through murky waters and the choice not to give up. And in the same vein, a man who
                    thinks there's no end in sight, which can move one into extreme events that includes depression,
                    suicide and sustained self harm.
                    I see now that the difference is Hope. It is that however dark it gets, it will get brighter. It's
                    the closest relative of Optimism, only its a very potent form of it.
                    Life has in its peculiarities Ups and downs. In the difficult moments, this expectation that it gets
                    better has to be locked in front of you, because you can get stuck in a rut, where you begin to lose
                    sight of what can be and something begins to give way on the inside. Stay long enough and you reach
                    a point of hopelessness and you don't even have the energy to continue.
                    When there's nothing to hope for, you lose yourself . That's where the Death is administered, it's
                    not the outright ceasing of your breath, but the decline that comes from what is already bleak.
                    Infusions of Hope is needed everyday, especially in the dry seasons of life. You need it for the
                    problems that don't outrightly disappear or the questions that are not answered with a snap. You
                    need it for the days you are under the weather. A glimmer of light on the darkest of days. The
                    strength to believe again.
                    Gratitude is one of the ways that helps to combat this. It brings freshness and causes us to pause
                    and reflect on how much to be grateful and eventually hopeful for. It helps to bring us back in
                    measures, the things we have lost sight of.
                    Scriptures says, “I pray that God, the source of hope, will fill you completely with joy and peace
                    because you trust in him. Then you will overflow with confident hope through the power of the Holy
                    Spirit.”
                    Romans 15:13
                    So in anxiety, Pain, disappointment, depression Jesus routes Hope in us by the help of the Spirit,
                    that is how we stay the course.</p>
