                    You see as with everything in life, it teaches us a lesson whether we accept the lesson is another
                    thing. You feel pain and emptiness, you try to understand the problem but it feels like the deeper
                    you dig, you just keep falling.
                    Your descent almost appears to be never-ending.
                    You wonder when the calm will sweep across the storm that is raging and looking to leave you broken
                    and helpless. Other times you are a spectator, hoping that as you have experienced the Storm, you
                    will witness the peace as well.
                    I really want to paint colors and rainbows and say you will come out of what you're going through
                    even if you can't see an end in sight and you're hurting. You will come out of whatever it is.
                    Yours might not have a quick fix, but healing is soon to come. In the words of a friend "the
                    wilderness is not just a place of abandonment, it is also a place for an expression of an
                    infilling."

                    Scriptures says"Consider it a sheer gift, friends, when tests and challenges come at you from all
                    sides. You know that under pressure, your faith-life is forced into the open and shows its true
                    colors. So don’t try to get out of anything prematurely. Let it do its work so you become mature and
                    well-developed, not deficient in any way.
                    James 1:2‭-‬4 MSG

                    So we’re not giving up. How could we! Even though on the outside it often looks like things are
                    falling apart on us, on the inside, where God is making new life, not a day goes by without his
                    unfolding grace. These hard times are small potatoes compared to the coming good times, the lavish
                    celebration prepared for us. There’s far more here than meets the eye. The things we see now are
                    here today, gone tomorrow. But the things we can’t see now will last forever.
                    2 Corinthians 4:16‭-‬18 MSG
