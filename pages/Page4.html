            <p>
                I stopped drinking carbonated drinks earlier this year, I just had to. It was bad for my health and so I
                knew I needed to stop taking it and every other form of added sugar. It's been going quite well, at
                least, a bottle doesn't tempt me anymore.
                <br>
                In the early weeks of quitting, when I go to a store and see it in the see-through refrigerator with the
                ice and sweat beads around it and just how chill it looks, I want to reach for one, but I remember that
                the temporary satisfaction of my desire is going to lead to a chain of bad reactions which will
                ultimately cause discomfort.
                <br>

                It was too much of a price so, I had to let the thought end there.

                In life, sometimes when we let go of things that seem to make us feel good in the now, but have negative
                turnovers in the long run, It feels like a loss, of course it is a loss. A loss at the feelings you
                couldn't express, a loss to not have what you want. Everything, however, is a tradeoff and I daresay, if
                It makes you a better human in the long term, it was a fair trade.
                <br>

                So, the compulsions you feel about the things you have left behind are normal. The things you had to let
                go even if it was for a greater good. It doesn't dull the pain you feel now. Your pain is not baseless.
                <br>

                Understanding that what you did has to be done, makes the burden lighter.

                Stay the course of discipline, you're mastering an essential life skill.
                <br>
                <br>

                Love and light
